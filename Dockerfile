# joi-button — Vue 2.7 static SPA, built once and served by unprivileged nginx.
#
# Build (what the first verification path does):
#   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 \
#     -t ghcr.io/ryanlan-new/joi-button/web:replace-me .
#
# --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM on the builder stage keeps the JS toolchain native
# to the build host (no QEMU for npm/webpack, which is where all the time goes)
# while the runtime stage is produced for the target arch.  dist/ is
# architecture-independent static text, so this is the standard split.
# The runtime stage contains no RUN instruction at all, so a cross-build never
# has to emulate a single target-arch process.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# stage 1 — build the static bundle
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# node:20-alpine, not bookworm-slim.  Checked against package-lock.json
# (lockfileVersion 3) rather than assumed:
#   * no node-sass anywhere; `sass` resolves to 1.77.8, which is dart-sass
#     compiled to JS — no libsass, no node-gyp, no python needed.
#     sass-loader 10.5.2 lists node-sass only as an OPTIONAL peer.
#   * the only packages with install scripts are core-js, ejs,
#     @apollo/protobufjs, yorkie (git-hook installer, skips when .git is
#     absent — and .dockerignore removes .git) and fsevents.  Every fsevents
#     entry is {"optional":true,"os":["darwin"]}, so npm skips it on linux and
#     its node-gyp build never runs.  musl is therefore not a risk here.
#   * every dependency resolves to registry.npmjs.org (0 git/tarball URLs), so
#     the image needs no git.
# Node 20 is pinned to match .github/workflows/deploy.yml (setup-node@v4,
# node-version: 20) — the version this lockfile is proven to build under.

# vue.config.js reads process.env.PUBLIC_PATH; since GitHub Pages was retired
# its own default is '/' too, so this ARG now RESTATES the default rather than
# overriding a different one.  It is kept because a subpath deployment would need
# it and because the gate below has to have a value to compare against.
ARG PUBLIC_PATH=/
ENV PUBLIC_PATH=${PUBLIC_PATH}

# NOTE: NODE_ENV is intentionally NOT set.  vue-cli-service sets it to
# production itself, whereas exporting it before `npm ci` risks dropping the
# devDependencies that provide vue-cli-service.
#
# THE GATE, and why it is no longer a grep for '/joi-button/'.
# It used to be `grep -q '/joi-button/js/'`, which worked while that string was
# vue.config.js's production default: a build that ignored PUBLIC_PATH emitted
# it, and the grep caught it.  With the default now '/', that grep can never
# match no matter what vue.config.js does — it would be a gate whose predicate
# cannot be false, i.e. decoration that reads like protection.
#
# So the gate asks the question directly instead: does the prefix on the emitted
# <script src> equal the PUBLIC_PATH we asked for?  It goes red if vue.config.js
# stops honouring PUBLIC_PATH, if a subpath build is served at the root, or if a
# root build is served under a subpath — including prefixes nobody has thought of
# yet.  Exercised in all three directions before being committed: a real
# PUBLIC_PATH=/ build reads '/' (green), a real PUBLIC_PATH=/sub/ build reads
# '/sub/' (green — so it is not red-always), and the root build checked against
# '/sub/', which is exactly "vue.config.js ignored PUBLIC_PATH", exits 1.
