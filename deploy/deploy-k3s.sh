# joi-button operator entrypoint for a single-node k3s cluster reached over ssh.
#
#   Usage:  deploy/deploy-k3s.sh [import|apply|all]
#
#     import   build BOTH images (web and api) for linux/amd64, stream each into the
#              cluster's containerd WITHOUT a registry, then ask the cluster whether
#              they arrived
#     apply    build the runtime Secret from deploy/runtime.env, render deploy/k8s
#              (replacing the literal 'replace-me' image tags on stdout only) and apply
#              it through the remote's kubectl, then wait for both rollouts
#     all      import, then apply  (this is also the default when no argument is given)
#
#   SITE-SPECIFIC VALUES LIVE OUTSIDE THIS REPOSITORY.
#   This is a public repository, so it carries no hostnames, no addresses and no
#   cluster identity of its own. Copy deploy/deploy.env.example to
#   deploy/deploy.env (git-ignored) and fill it in, or export the same names in
#   your shell. Nothing here has a fallback that would quietly point at somebody
#   else's cluster: the two values that identify a deployment are REQUIRED.
#
#   Required (no default — the script refuses to guess):
#     REMOTE                 ssh host alias of the k3s node          (import, apply)
#     APP_HOST               hostname the Ingress serves             (apply)
#
#   Also required for `apply`, and NOT an environment variable:
#     deploy/runtime.env     the API's credentials and settings. Copy
#                            deploy/runtime.env.example and fill it in; it is
#                            git-ignored. `apply` turns it into the Secret
#                            `joi-button-runtime` that the API pod reads with
#                            envFrom, and refuses to proceed without it — a pod
#                            whose envFrom names a missing Secret never starts,
#                            and reports that as a rollout timeout naming nothing.
#                            The values travel over ssh into kubectl's stdin; they
#                            are never written to the node's disk and never printed.
#                            Override the path with RUNTIME_ENV_FILE=...
#
#   Optional:
#     LB_ADDRESS             ingress load-balancer address, used only to print a
#                            DNS-independent curl at the end

#     KUBECTL                default "sudo k3s kubectl"           (see the note below)
#     MANIFEST_DIR           default deploy/k8s
#     ROLLOUT_TIMEOUT        default 120s
#     RESTART_IF_UNCHANGED   default 1                            (see the note below)
#     SMOKE                  default 1     run deploy/smoke-image.sh before shipping
#     ALLOW_REGISTRY_PULL    default 0     permit applying a tag absent from the node
#     ENV_FILE               default deploy/deploy.env
#
#   TAGS: this script builds and deploys `dev-<short7-sha>` (plus `-dirty` when the
#   working tree is not clean). CI publishes bare `<short7-sha>` to GHCR. The two
#   namespaces are separate on purpose — see the comment at the TAG default — so
#   deploying a CI image means naming it:
#     ALLOW_REGISTRY_PULL=1 TAG=<short7-sha> deploy/deploy-k3s.sh apply
#
#   ASSUMPTION, stated so it can be checked rather than believed: a stock k3s node has
#   no standalone kubectl binary -- kubectl is reached as a k3s subcommand, and reading
#   /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml needs root. Hence the KUBECTL default is "sudo k3s kubectl".
#   If your node has a real kubectl with a readable kubeconfig, override it:
#     KUBECTL=kubectl deploy/deploy-k3s.sh apply
#   Import also needs passwordless sudo on the remote, because the image tar arrives on
#   stdin and a sudo password prompt has nowhere to read from. That is preflighted.
#
#   The repository must stay clean: the manifests keep their 'replace-me' placeholders —
#   the image tag, and the Ingress host `replace-me.invalid` — and are never edited in
#   place. Substitution happens on a pipe. `.invalid` is the RFC 2606 reserved TLD, so a
#   placeholder that somehow escapes substitution can never resolve to a real host.
#
#   RESTART_IF_UNCHANGED: with imagePullPolicy IfNotPresent, re-importing new bytes under
#   an already-deployed tag leaves the Deployment spec byte-identical, so the apply is a
#   no-op, no pods restart, and "rollout status" would happily report success while the
#   old bytes keep serving. When the Deployment's generation does not move, this script
#   therefore issues an explicit "rollout restart". Set RESTART_IF_UNCHANGED=0 to opt out.
