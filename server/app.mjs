// The HTTP surface: a configured fastify instance that is NOT listening.
//
// createApp() takes everything it needs as arguments and constructs none of it.
// That is what lets a test drive the whole surface against a temporary database
// and a programmable danmaku double, and it is also the ownership rule: this
// file never closes the database and never stops the room session, because it
// did not open them. server.mjs owns those.
//
// WHY THE GUARD REPORT IS AN ARGUMENT, AND WHAT ITS ABSENCE MEANS.
// `report` is what assertSafeConfig() returned. Two things here need it, and
// neither can be derived a second time without inventing a second answer to a
// question env-guard has already answered:
//
//   1. the bypass banner. env-guard's own header states the contract an HTTP
//      layer owes it: when report.banner is not null, set the header on EVERY
//      response and serve the banner in the health document. Until this file
//      existed, nothing did — the comment there says so in as many words.
//   2. the Secure attribute on the session cookie.
//
// When `report` is absent the deployment is treated as PRODUCTION: banner off,
// Secure on. That is not a guess dressed as a default — it is env-guard's own
// rule that a permissive environment must be asserted rather than inferred from
// silence. A test that hands over the five documented arguments and no report
// therefore gets the strict answer.
//
// HOW THE LOCAL-DEV COOKIE EXCEPTION CANNOT LEAK INTO PRODUCTION.
// A cookie without Secure is sent over plain HTTP, so it is readable by anything
// on the path. Local development over http://localhost needs exactly that, and
// the request for it (DEV_PLAIN_HTTP, config.session.allowPlainHttp) is a plain
// boolean an operator can set anywhere. What makes it safe is that it is not
// consulted alone: the effective value is
//
//     secure = report.production ? true : !config.session.allowPlainHttp
//
// and `report.production` is the OR of NODE_ENV === 'production', the database's
// own instance.mode === 'production', and "the mode could not be read at all".
// So reaching the insecure branch requires NODE_ENV to be something other than
// production AND the database file itself to be stamped 'development' — a mark
// migrate() writes and a trigger in schema.sql ratchets one way, so a database
// that has ever been production can never be talked back down. Setting the flag
// on a production deployment does not weaken the cookie; it does nothing at all.
//
// THE COOKIE NAME IS THE SAME IN BOTH, AND THAT IS A DECISION.
// The obvious upgrade is the `__Host-` prefix, which browsers enforce: Secure,
// Path=/, no Domain, so no sibling subdomain and nothing on plain HTTP can write
// it. It was not taken, because the prefix requires Secure and would therefore
// make the cookie's NAME depend on the deployment — and the name is not private
// to this file. routes/admin.mjs resolves an identity from a cookie it looks up
// BY NAME, with 'joi_session' as its default. A name that is right on a laptop
// and wrong in production would make the admin gate answer 404 to its owner,
// which that file's own comment points out is indistinguishable from a working
// access check. One stable name, plus Secure, plus Path=/ and no Domain (which
// already makes the cookie host-only), is the trade this deployment is worth.
//
// WHAT THE SIGNATURE BUYS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.
// The credential is 32 bytes from randomBytes; nobody can produce a value whose
// sha256 matches a stored session row without having been given it, signed or
// not. The HMAC buys exactly one thing: a cookie that this process did not mint
// is refused without a database query. That is worth having — it is the
// difference between a junk-cookie flood costing an HMAC each and costing a
// lookup each — but it is not what makes a session unforgeable. The entropy is.
//
// So the whole cookie value, signature included, is what sessions.token_sha256
// holds the sha256 of. That keeps one string in play instead of two, and it
// means anything that hashes the raw cookie value — routes/admin.mjs's default
// identity resolver does exactly that — finds the same row this file would.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT MAKES THIS GO RED
//
//   * Default `report` to a permissive value (`report = { production: false }`)
//     — the "no report means Secure" case goes red.
//   * Drop the `production ||` from the cookie decision, or read
//     allowPlainHttp on its own — the "DEV_PLAIN_HTTP is inert in production"
//     case goes red.
//   * Change SESSION_COOKIE_NAME without changing routes/admin.mjs's
//     DEFAULT_COOKIE_NAME — nothing here goes red, and that is the point of
//     saying it: the case that would catch it is an integration test that logs
//     in and then reaches an admin route, and until one exists these two
//     constants are held in step by this sentence alone.
//   * Compare the cookie signature with === instead of timingSafeEqual — no test
//     can prove that red, and saying so is the point: this one is not covered by
//     a case, it is covered by review. Do not add a timing test; a timing test on
//     a shared CI runner is a flake generator, not a gate.
//   * Let the database probe read instead of write (a SELECT instead of the
//     UPDATE below) — the "readiness goes red on a read-only volume" case goes
//     red, because a read-only SQLite file answers a SELECT perfectly.
//   * Fold roomSession into the readiness decision — the "the room session is
//     absent by design and readiness stays green" case goes red. That case is
//     the whole reason the three checks are separate: the session is started ON
//     DEMAND, so for most of any given day the honest answer is "nobody has
//     asked for one", and a readiness probe that read that as a fault would
//     restart a pod for behaving exactly as ruled.
//   * Set multipart's `parts` limit below files + fields — an over-numerous
//     batch then trips FST_PARTS_LIMIT instead of FST_FILES_LIMIT and the
//     submitter is told about a rule they have never heard of instead of the
//     ruled 10-clip cap.
//   * Return the fastify default body for a multipart refusal — the "the
//     refusal names which rule was broken, and its number" case goes red.
