// The only file in this process that reads the environment.
//
// Everything downstream — app.mjs, server.mjs, the routes later stories add —
// receives a plain object. `process.env` appears exactly once below, and
// `deploy/runtime.env` is parsed exactly once below, so "where does this value
// come from?" has one answer and a test can supply a different environment
// without touching the machine it runs on.
//
// TWO CONSUMERS, ONE FILE. deploy/runtime.env.example says it: on the cluster
// that file becomes a Kubernetes Secret mounted with envFrom, and locally the
// API reads it directly. So both paths are honoured here, and the REAL
// environment wins over the file — in the pod there is no file, and on a laptop
// an explicit `SESSION_SECRET=… node server.mjs` should not be silently ignored
// in favour of a stale line in a file the operator forgot about.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE VALIDATES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.
// This file owns SYNTAX and PROVENANCE: "MAX_FILE_BYTES is not an integer",
// "ADMIN_OPEN_IDS contains an entry with a space in it". It is the only layer
// that knows the NAME an operator typed, so it is the only layer that can put
// that name in the message.
//
// lib/env-guard.mjs owns POLICY: ruled ceilings, required keys, and the refusal
// to run a development bypass in production. Those checks are NOT duplicated
// here — a ceiling enforced in two places is a ceiling that can be raised in one
// of them. What this file does instead is export ENV_SOURCES, so the entry point
// can translate the guard's config paths back into the variable names the
// operator actually set.
//
// WHY PATHS ARE NOT RESOLVED TO ABSOLUTE FORM HERE.
// It is one path.resolve() away and it would be a mistake. env-guard refuses a
// relative storage path in production, because a relative path resolves against
// the container's WORKDIR rather than the mounted PVC; resolving here would hand
// that check an absolute path every time and the refusal could never fire again.
// A gate whose predicate cannot be false is not a gate. So DATA_DIR reaches the
// guard exactly as it was written.
//

// ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES THIS FILE READS
//
// Published by deploy/runtime.env.example, spelled exactly as it publishes them:
//
//   BILI_APP_ID  BILI_ROOM_ID  BILI_ACCESS_KEY_ID  BILI_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET
//   BILI_ROOM_OWNER_AUTH_CODE  TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY  TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY
//   ADMIN_OPEN_IDS  SESSION_SECRET  DATA_DIR  DB_FILE  MEDIA_DIR  CATALOG_FILE
//   MAX_CLIPS_PER_BATCH  MAX_FILE_BYTES  DEV_BYPASS_DANMAKU  DEV_BYPASS_TURNSTILE
//   DANMAKU_MODE  TURNSTILE_MODE
//
// NOT published there — the template should grow them, and until it does this
// comment is the only place they are written down:
//
//   NODE_ENV            'production' | 'development' | 'test'. Never defaulted;
//                       see env-guard on why an unset NODE_ENV is a refusal.
//   PORT, HOST          the listener. Nothing can start without them.
//   LOG_LEVEL           pino level.
//   TRUST_PROXY         hop count or trusted-address list; see readTrustProxy.
//   TURNSTILE_SWITCH    REQUIRED by env-guard's roster (turnstile.switch), and
//                       it is the operator's 1am kill switch, so it has to be
//                       settable without a rebuild.
//   CODE_TTL_MINUTES    REQUIRED by env-guard's roster (danmaku.codeTtlMinutes).
//   SESSION_TTL_HOURS   how long a bound session cookie stays valid.
//   DEV_PLAIN_HTTP      drops Secure from the session cookie. Inert outside a
//                       process the guard resolved as non-production; see
//                       app.mjs, which is where it is ANDed with that answer.
