// Everything a visitor touches: identity through the live room, API credentials,
// the batch upload, and the submitter's own history.
//
// A fastify plugin, deliberately NOT wrapped in fastify-plugin, so the routes and
// the helpers below stay in their own scope.
//
// TWO THINGS IT SHARES RATHER THAN OWNS, both because the alternative was a
// second copy that merely agreed:
//
//   * @fastify/multipart. A content-type parser for multipart/form-data may be
//     registered exactly once for a given fastify scope chain — a second one is
//     FST_ERR_CTP_ALREADY_PRESENT at boot, taking the whole app down and not one
//     route. app.mjs registers it at the root with the ruled limits, so this file
//     registers it only when nobody has, and asks for the one option it cannot
//     inherit (throwFileSizeLimit) per request instead.
//   * the session cookie. app.mjs mints `token.hmac` and stores the sha256 of the
//     whole string; routes/admin.mjs resolves an identity by hashing the raw
//     cookie value. A session minted here with a differently-shaped value would
//     hash to a row admin.mjs can find and be refused by app.mjs's parse() — the
//     admin gate answering 404 to its own owner, which app.mjs's header points
//     out is indistinguishable from a working access check. So this file uses
//     fastify.sessionCookie when there is one, and only falls back to a local
//     equivalent so the plugin can still be registered on a bare instance.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHY THE CODE IS NOT IN THE RESPONSE TO /api/login/start
// ===========================================================================
// The one-time code is only worth anything if we are listening when the visitor
// sends it. A code handed over while the socket is still opening loses the
// danmaku of anyone quick — and the visitor is then told, by a system that has no
// idea it was deaf, that they must have typed it wrong. So start() returns a
// `preparing` state and a poll token, and the code appears on /api/login/status
// only once the source reports it is actually listening.
//
// The 10-minute clock starts when listening began, not when the request arrived,
// and this file does not compute that instant — it READS it, from the status
// snapshot acquire() resolves with (`listeningSince`). Two consequences, both
// deliberate:
//
//   * there is no second clock to disagree with the source's. `issued_at` IS the
//     source's own `listeningSince`, so status({ since: issued_at }) compares a
//     value against itself and the "have we been listening continuously since the
//     code was issued?" question is exact rather than approximately exact.
//   * a start that took four seconds costs the visitor nothing. Their ten minutes
//     begin when their code becomes real.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHAT room-unreachable IS FOR
// ===========================================================================
// danmaku-source.mjs draws one distinction and refuses to blur it: only
// LISTENING_NO_MATCH licenses telling a visitor their message did not arrive.
// This file carries that all the way to the wire.
//
//   preparing         we are opening the socket; there is no code yet
//   waiting           the code is live. `canAssertNotSeen` says whether we may
//                     tell them we have not seen it
//   verified          done
//   expired           the ten minutes ran out, or they cancelled
//   room-unreachable  our side cannot see the room right now
//
// `canAssertNotSeen: false` inside `waiting` is the third case and the one a UI
// most easily gets wrong: we ARE listening, but there was a gap since the code
// was issued, so a danmaku sent during it is simply gone. That is not
// room-unreachable — the room is reachable, right now — and it is emphatically
// not "you have not sent it yet". The contract for the frontend is one line: the
// sentence "we have not seen your message" may be rendered when, and only when,
// `canAssertNotSeen` is true.
//
// ===========================================================================
// THE SUBMITTER NOTE ENVELOPE
// ===========================================================================
// batch_items has proposed_label, proposed_group_id and submitter_note, and no
// column for the caption, its locale, or a proposed NEW group name. Adding three
// columns to db/schema.sql is not this file's call, and audit.mjs already set the
// precedent for the alternative: put the fields the table has no column for into
// the one text column, in a documented envelope, and export the reader so there
// is one parser rather than one per consumer. See readSubmitterNote().
//
//     { "caption": { "locale": "zh-CN", "text": "…" },
//       "note": "…" | null,
//       "proposedGroup": "…" | null }
//
// Key order is fixed so the same submission serialises to the same bytes.
//
// A proposed new group is a PROPOSAL and never a row in `groups`. Minting an
// active group from submitter text would put submitter-chosen text into a
// display_name that the unique index makes globally exclusive, i.e. hand any
// verified visitor a lever on the catalogue's shape. The reviewer creates groups.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHY INGEST FAILURES ARE NOT PERSISTED AS batch_items
// ===========================================================================
// A file that is not audio has no media row — media.sha256 is the FK target and
// the four-way (content_type, ext) CHECK is the whole allow-list — so there is
// literally no batch_items row to write for it. That is the table agreeing with
// the product: batch_items.state 'rejected'/'failed' means a REVIEWER decided,
// and both require a reviewer_note. An upload that never became a clip candidate
// is not a review outcome. So per-item ingest verdicts live in the response, and
// the good items are persisted alongside them.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHY SNIFFING GOES THROUGH music-metadata AND NOT THROUGH parseFile(name)
// ===========================================================================
// Measured against the installed music-metadata 11.14.0: parseFile() TRUSTS the
// path's extension. An mp3 copied to `blob.wav` comes back with
// `container: undefined` and NO ERROR, and a PNG copied to `img.mp3` does the
// same — a silent pass, not a refusal. The same PNG at a path with no extension
// at all is refused outright (UnsupportedFileTypeError), and the same mp3 at an
// extension-less path is identified correctly.
//
// So the temp file this route streams to has NO extension, and there is an
// assertion saying so, because the property is load-bearing and invisible: the
// day somebody appends '.part' for tidiness, this route starts believing
// filenames again. Classification is then this file's own table (classifyAudio),
// keyed on what the parser found in the bytes.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT MAKES THIS GO RED
//
//   * Return `code` from POST /api/login/start, or mint it before acquire()
//     resolves — the "no code before the socket is listening" case goes red.
//     Only observable because the development transport can be given a start
//     latency: with an instantly-ready double, start() and status() are
//     indistinguishable and the guard could never be evaluated in a world where
//     it could be false.
//   * Drop either half of onListening's `max(requestedAt, listeningSince)`, and
//     note that the two halves have DIFFERENT red inputs, which is why neither is
//     redundant. Take requestedAt alone: a start that takes five seconds spends
//     five seconds of the visitor's ten minutes, and status({ since }) then reads
//     LISTENING_AFTER_GAP and tells them to resend the code they were just given.
//     Take listeningSince alone: a second visitor arriving while the socket is
//     already up inherits the first visitor's marker, gets five minutes instead
//     of ten, and is told we were listening through a window they were not in.
//   * Map LISTENING_AFTER_GAP to `waiting` with canAssertNotSeen true, or map it
//     to room-unreachable — the first tells a visitor who did everything right
//     that they did not send it, the second tells them our side is broken while
//     it is working. Red input: acquire, mint, control.disconnect(), let the
//     reconnect land, then poll.
//   * Map NOT_LISTENING / RECONNECTING / FAILED to anything but room-unreachable
//     — the "a dead room is never reported as 'you have not sent it yet'" case
//     goes red.
//   * Drop the `attempt.abandoned` check in the acquire continuation — red input:
//     POST /api/login/start, then POST /api/login/cancel before the source
//     becomes ready. The lease taken by the abandoned start is never released and
//     pins the socket for the full lease TTL.
//   * Release leases with a counter instead of by lease id, or skip the onClose
//     hook — the source's refcount never returns to zero and the socket outlives
//     the plugin.
//   * Give the temp file an extension, or pass a mimeType to parseFile — the
//     parser stops sniffing and believes the name. The assertion in drainFile is
//     what makes that a crash rather than a silent change of behaviour.
//   * Widen classifyAudio to accept `container: 'MPEG'` without the Layer 3 test,
//     or to accept an ftyp file with hasVideo — an MPEG Layer 2 stream is stored
//     as .mp3 and an mp4 VIDEO is stored as .m4a. The Layer 2 case has a real
//     fixture (a hand-built MPEG-1 Layer II elementary stream): it reports
//     container 'MPEG' with a plausible duration, so without that fixture the
//     test passes with the check deleted.
//   * Sweep the temp files after the response instead of before it — the "nothing
//     is left in media/tmp" case goes red, because reply.send() returns before an
//     unlink scheduled after it has run. "Gone by the time the submitter is told"
//     is checkable; "gone shortly afterwards" is not.
//   * Answer a poll token that belongs to a different session — the
//     "one session may not poll another session's token" case goes red.
//   * Trust a client's preflight answer instead of re-running the rate query at
//     submit time — red input: preflight while the submitter is under the limit,
//     then submit after crossing it. The second submission is admitted.
//   * Abort the whole request on the first bad item — the "item 3 failing does
//     not lose items 1, 2, 4 and 5" case goes red. `throwFileSizeLimit: false` is
//     half of that: with the default, one oversized file throws and takes the
//     other four with it.
//   * Create a batch when every item was refused — batches_resolve_needs_all_-
//     items_resolved makes an empty batch unresolvable forever, so it would sit
//     in 'submitted' for the life of the database.
//   * Put a '{', '}', '|' or '@:' into any sentence in PUBLIC_REASONS — the
//     module-level assertion throws at import. These strings are rendered through
//     vue-i18n by the frontend, and this file authored them, so they are REFUSED
//     rather than escaped (env-guard.mjs makes the same argument for its banner:
//     escape what you cannot control, refuse what you can).
