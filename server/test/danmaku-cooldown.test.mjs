// JOI-BUTTON-INC-006: the platform's restart cooldown, and the two things that
// answer it.
//
// WHAT WAS MEASURED (2026-08-01, real credentials, room 3622717). After a stop
// that had FULLY SETTLED — state 'stopped', zero waiters, /v2/app/end returned —
// an immediate /v2/app/start answered `code 7001 (请求冷却期)`, and the same call
// at +15s succeeded. Cold starts took 5.6–7.1s. Heartbeats ticked every 20s with
// no errors.
//
// WHY IT MATTERS. This site's only login is: ask for a code, send it as a
// danmaku, get recognised. The room session opens for that and closes on
// success. So the ordinary sequence
//
//     visitor A verifies  ->  session stops  ->  visitor B asks for a code
//
// puts B's start inside the cooldown, and B is told the room is unreachable —
// a false report, about the one path the whole site depends on.
//
// THE TWO ANSWERS, and why one alone is not enough:
//
//   linger  keeps the socket open for a while after the LAST waiter lets go, so
//           B arrives while it is still open and waits for nothing. This removes
//           the cooldown from the common path and MOVES the window rather than
//           closing it: somebody arriving just after the linger expires still
//           lands in it.
//   retry   waits the cooldown out inside acquire(), so the visitor in that
//           window sees a longer "准备中" instead of an error.
//
// Both are exercised here against the development transport, which now carries a
// knob that produces exactly the rejection shape lib/bili-transport puts on a
// 7001. Without that knob the retry is unfalsifiable: a test that never sees a
// retryable rejection cannot tell a loop that waits and succeeds from one that
// gives up.
