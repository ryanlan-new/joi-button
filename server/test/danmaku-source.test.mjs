// Every case here needs the programmable double to be slow, to fail, to hang or
// to drop. A double that is ready instantly and never drops makes two of the
// real implementation's guards vacuously true — "the code must not be shown
// before the socket is listening" cannot fail against a source that is
// listening before you finish asking, and "never tell a visitor who did
// everything right that they are probably muted" cannot fail against a source
// that never disconnects.
//
// The clock is injected for the same reason: without it "the start that never
// becomes ready" costs ten real seconds and gets skipped.
