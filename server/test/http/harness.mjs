// The whole server, assembled the way server.mjs assembles it, driven through
// app.inject(). No socket is bound and no credential exists — which is the point:
// this is the proof that the composition works BEFORE anyone has a Bilibili
// access key or a Turnstile secret.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHAT IS REAL HERE AND WHAT IS A DOUBLE
// ===========================================================================
// REAL: db/schema.sql on a file-backed SQLite database in WAL, the config that
// assertSafeConfig() cleared, createApp() with @fastify/multipart at the root,
// routes/public.mjs, routes/admin.mjs, lib/catalog.mjs writing onto a real
// directory, lib/audit.mjs, the session cookie app.mjs mints.
//
// DOUBLE: exactly two, and both are the ones the foundation ships for this.
//
//   the danmaku source   mode 'development'. It is DRIVEN, not merely present:
//                        its start latency, its failure mode and its mid-wait
//                        disconnect are set from the tests. "The code is not
//                        shown before the socket is listening" cannot fail
//                        against a source that is listening before you finish
//                        asking — that guard would sit green forever, never
//                        having been evaluated in a world where it could be
//                        false.
//   Turnstile            two shapes, and which one a test picks is load-bearing:
//                        'stub'        mode 'production' with config.fetchImpl
//                                      pointed at a recording double. The REAL
//                                      verify() path runs — including the
//                                      single-use token map, which the
//                                      development verifier returns before ever
//                                      reaching. A test that claims "the token
//                                      is single-use" and runs against the
//                                      development verifier is testing nothing.
//                        'development' the always-passes verifier, whose verdict
//                                      carries `simulated: true` and is recorded
//                                      as 'bypassed' rather than 'passed'.
//
// Both of those config keys (verifyUrl, fetchImpl) are refuse-severity bypasses
// in env-guard's roster, so this composition is CONSTRUCTABLE ONLY because the
// database is stamped 'development' and NODE_ENV is not production. On a
// production instance assertSafeConfig() throws and no app is built at all —
// which is why the guard is called here with the real database handle rather
// than being told an answer.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHY THE COOKIE NAME IS NOT PASSED TO routes/admin.mjs
// ===========================================================================
// app.mjs exports SESSION_COOKIE_NAME and routes/admin.mjs carries its own
// DEFAULT_COOKIE_NAME, and app.mjs's header says outright that the two are held
// in step "by this sentence alone" until an integration test logs in and then
// reaches an admin route. This harness deliberately does NOT pass `cookieName`,
// so every admin case in this directory depends on the two constants agreeing;
// change one without the other and the owner is answered 404 by their own
// server, which is exactly the failure that is indistinguishable from a working
// access check. admin-gate.test.mjs states it directly as well.
//
// ===========================================================================
// NOTE ON DISCOVERY
// ===========================================================================
// `npm test` runs `node --test` with no positional, which discovers every file
// under test/ (the runner's `**/test/**/*.{cjs,mjs,js}` pattern), so this
// directory is picked up without being listed anywhere. test/index.js — the
// entry point for the `node --test test/` form — carries a hand-written import
// list that does not name this directory (nor test/routes-public.test.mjs);
// test/http/index.js does the same job for this directory.
