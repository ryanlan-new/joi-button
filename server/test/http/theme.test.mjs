// The theme, driven over HTTP: the four routes an owner's form talks to.
//
// The unit tests next door prove what a theme MAY be (test/theme.test.mjs) and
// what happens to an uploaded picture (test/wallpaper.test.mjs). What is proved
// here is the part neither of them can see:
//
//   * the four routes are behind the same allow-list as the rest of the desk, and
//     a stranger gets the answer a MISSING route gets, not a 403 that confirms
//     the route is there;
//   * a refusal leaves the volume byte-for-byte as it was — the assertion is on
//     the FILE, because "nothing was stored" is a claim about the disk and not
//     about a status code;
//   * a save and a delete both land on the log.
//
// The "good" palette is the one GET hands the form. Retyping sixteen colours
// here would mean these cases could keep passing against a palette the site does
// not ship.
//
// Three cases at the bottom are not about a request at all. They are about the
// three ways this suite was structurally unable to see a production failure:
// it runs from a tree where src/ is a sibling (so a route reading src/App.vue
// looked fine while the image has no src/), and its harness hands the plugin the
// same two storage keys server.mjs did (so two REQUIRED environment variables
// could be ignored with every test green). A gate that cannot go red for the
// world it is protecting is not a gate.
